## Getting Started

First, install a Pascal compiler.

Next, fork the repository. Then, go into your favorite terminal.

    git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/boulder-dash.git
    cd boulder-dash

Now, while still inside the `boulder-dash` folder, compile the project and click on the main.exe.

## Systems and Engines

Here are the types of things I will be adding as a minimum viable product (alpha). Not too over the top but enough to cover the basics until more is added. Each section links to a project which will contain its sub-tasks within.
